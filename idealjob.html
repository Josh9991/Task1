<p>My ideal job is to continue working in the family business. My current job tittle is support and migration specialist, which entails migrating new clients onto our platform and supporting them once they are on. I would like to take over more responsibility in the business.</p>

<p>To take myself to the next level there are some skills that I require to improve on. I need to further my project management skills so that I can lead teams from multiple businesses on various projects. I need a better understanding on most areas IT to become a better generalist.</p>
