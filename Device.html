<h1 style="text-align: center;">Project Idea</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">This project will be to utilize a raspberry pie along with lights that can change colours, a microphone and a speaker to make a baby soother. When a baby is a poor sleeper the raspberry pie will attempt to train the baby to sleep recommended hours utilising a sleep schedule and react to baby waking then attempt to settle the baby utilising the speaker and lights. The device will also train the parents on things like how long to wait before manually settling the baby, what to do to settle baby, etc.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Motivation</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">There are many guides on how to get your kids to sleep with many theories, the goal of this project is to give parents a tool to tell them what to do at any given time and assist the baby to go to sleep. Poor sleep in children has been found to be negative on children&rsquo;s overall health, with the rate of obstructive sleep aponia being around 2% to 3% in children (Krader &amp; Honaker 2018). Raspberry pi is an easily adaptable and cost effective product that can be utilised in this product.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Parents often battle with their children to get them to sleep. This product will be placed in an infant&rsquo;s room, when the infant wakes a microphone will hear the baby making noise like crying or laughing, which will trigger the device to start playing white noise and/or illuminating the infant&rsquo;s room with a light attempting to soothe the infant back to sleep. If the infant remains awake for a certain amount of time and the soothing does not work, it will alert the parents to come and manually soothe the infant for a certain time when it will let them know what to do next, corresponding with an escalating schedule. This will repeat until the infant has been settled back to sleep. If the infant is sleeping for a longer period than recommended, then the device will start a slow wakeup routine where it could start lighting up the room with the built in light and/or playing sound through the speaker.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A raspberry pie will be used as it can be easily implemented with the other equipment within and can be connected to the internet to achieve tasks like sending a sleep report to the parents or taking updates. A speaker will play white noise and other noises that are recorded onto the device. A light will be on a dome on top of the device and can be changed depending on the schedule for example a blue light to wake the infant in the morning or a red light to soothe at night. There will be a USB port on the exterior of the case for updates and possible future expansions. Possible future expansions could include an infant&rsquo;s vital monitor that monitors the infant&rsquo;s heartrate and breathing to prevent SID&rsquo;s, a baby monitor linked to an app on a phone, a camera so the parents can check on the infant and a thermomotor so the device can give a guide on what to dress the infant in.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This device will follow a schedule of the parent&rsquo;s choice and age of the child which corresponds to a professional&rsquo;s recommendation. The schedule should include hours the infant should be awake/asleep, time that the infant should be soothed for before human intervention is required and escalation if required.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Further research is required on safe cable management to prevent infant chocking on charge cable or pulling the device off of a shelf. Ways to mitigate this could be a sticky surface below the device to prevent the device from being pulled from the shelf or having the device powered by batteries.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The device will be made up of a raspberry pi, speaker, microphone, colour changing light and it will all be contained within a protective case. The device will run on a raspberry pi with a program written in python programming language due to its simplicity and efficiency.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Skills Required</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Due to the device utilising python as its program language, knowledge for python will be required. According to TIOBE (2019) Python is currently the 3rd most common programming language in the world. Since python is the 3rd most popular programming language there is a large library of help available online. Raspberry pi is also common and readily available with many sensors/ad-ons available along with a large community support network. A specialist may be required to have the device functioning correctly and efficiently.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Outcome</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">If this product is successful, health of children and parents could be improved with infants sleeping for recommended periods of time. The device could simplify complex sleep schedules and assist parents to follow the recommended schedule. Healthcare professionals could also use data collected by the device to give further recommendations or diagnose sleep aponia in children.</p>
