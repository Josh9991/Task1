<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Interest in IT</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">My interests in IT began when I was at the computer store with my dad. He would give me tasks to do from a young age or I would play games on the computers to pass time. Eventually as I got older I would come along to client offices and help out with migrations. When I was 20 I joined the army and became a tank commander but became bored, so I left and joined the family business which I have been doing for two years now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I have been studying at the University of the Sunshine Coast for the past year but it was not flexible with work and family commitments, so I have changed over to RMIT so that I can study while I am away for work or have other commitments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">During my studies I am expecting to learn many new skills and improve my knowledge in programming, system infrastructure, security, along with other subjects that I do not yet know about. By increasing my knowledge I am hoping to be more professional to take myself and the business to the next level.</p>
