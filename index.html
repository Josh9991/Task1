<p>Hi, my name Is Joshua Barton.</p>
<p>I have been around computers since being born as my family owned a computer store. From a young age I would go to the computer store and help out or play games on the computers. When I got older, I left school and joined the army for 6 years. Eventually I needed a change and I was still playing around with computers for fun.</p>
<p>I went back to the family business which had changed a lot, the family business was now providing cloud solutions to the insurance industry. I have been back working in the family business for two years and already picked up many new facts. I will need to learn a lot more to take over other jobs within the business and take it to the next stage.</p>
<p>I have been studying at the University of the Sunshine Coast for the past year but it was not flexible with work and family commitments, so I have changed over to RMIT so that I can study while I am away for work or have other commitments.</p>
